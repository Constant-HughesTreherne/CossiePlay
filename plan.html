<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>In order to shine light on CossiePlay a web presence is necessary for the small home grown business. A web presence would increase the opportunity and client base CossiePlay have at the moment. Having a website would increase the distance which CossiePlay can reach and cater for a new market. This will help with the growth CossiePlay is seeking.

Branching out to attract more customers is the ulimate long term goal. By doing this more customers would be satisfied with their experience and possibly attract more people to the Cosplay universe.
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> CossiePlay is looking at increasing its customer base which it currently has. Currently a very specific age group are associated with CossiePlay and by adding a website to their portfolio would increase their reach they have to attract other customers, predominantly a younger customer base would be very welcoming.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>CossiePlay is a niche company that supplies a service requested by a niche market. The aim is to supply tailor made costumes to the customer on request. The target audience are those that attend CosPlay events, usually this would include people interested in CosPlay. However at this time being a local business there has not been much online presence. CossiePlay hopes with the addition of a webiste, they could potentially attract a younger group of customers to CosPlay</p>
